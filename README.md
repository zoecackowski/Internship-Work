 I had a Digital Marketing Internship at Avidxchange where I focused a lot of my time on paid search, email marketing, and collaborating with different teams like the design team to help me. My final project was working with ON24, a webinar platform that Avidxchange used especially during Covid to connect with their target audience and teach more about their products. I helped them by meeting with people and gathering feedback on how they used it previously and what theyâ€™d like to come from it going forward. My feedback allowed me to help them by organizing the webinars they already had, and redesigned new logos, backgrounds, and action buttons to make it more entertaining for the attendees and the hosts.
